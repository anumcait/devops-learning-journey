# 🚀 AWS Cloud Infrastructure Project: EC2, VPC, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer & Bastion Host 🌐

## 📢 Overview:
I’m super excited to share this project where I built a **scalable**, **secure**, and **fault-tolerant** infrastructure on **AWS**! This repository contains the steps and scripts to set up a **VPC**, deploy **EC2 instances**, configure **Auto Scaling**, and integrate an **Application Load Balancer** (ALB). 🔧

🔒 **Key Features**:
- **VPC Setup** with public and private subnets for secure network segregation.
- **Auto Scaling** ensures the number of EC2 instances scales based on traffic demand! 📈
- **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) distributes traffic evenly across EC2 instances.
- **Bastion Host** allows secure access to instances in private subnets. 🔑

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Amazon EC2** 💻  
- **AWS VPC** 🌐  
- **Auto Scaling** 📊  
- **Load Balancer (ALB)** 🌎  
- **Security Groups** 🔒  
- **Python 3.x** 🐍

## 📈 Deployment Steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or your cloud environment.
2. Set up your AWS environment and configure IAM permissions.
3. Run the **CloudFormation** template or follow the manual setup steps in the `/infrastructure` directory.
4. Deploy the **Python HTTP server** on the EC2 instances in your private subnet.
5. Configure the **Application Load Balancer** to route traffic to your EC2 instances.
6. Enjoy a fully scalable, secure web app! 🎉

## 📑 Project Details:
This project is designed to showcase the power of **AWS cloud infrastructure** for modern web applications. The goal was to create a system that can **scale automatically** to meet demand, provide secure access to private instances, and ensure that traffic is balanced evenly for maximum uptime.

## 🌟 Why This is Exciting:
- **Scalable Architecture**: This project can be the foundation for a wide variety of web applications, from small startups to large-scale services. 📈  
- **Real-World Use Case**: Auto scaling, load balancing, and secure network setups are essential in **cloud-native environments**. 🌍  
- **Hands-On Learning**: This project has expanded my knowledge of AWS services and cloud architecture best practices. 🙌

## ⚡ Get Started:
